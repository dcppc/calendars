# Data Commons - Calendars

This repository contains scripts for combining Groups.io 
calendars into a single integrated Data Commons calendar. 

This is mainly one script that scrapes events from all the
calendar feeds and combines them into a single calendar feed.
It is meant to be run on a server or a Heroku node.
